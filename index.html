        <p>It's been a quiet end of the year for ams.rb, but we're determined to pick things up again in 2016. :)</p>

        <p>This will be the first one. Some talks, some drinks, and the chance to wish each other the best for the New Year!</p>

        <p>Let us know if you want to talk, host or sponsor, contact us through <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-rb/" title="Amsterdam.rb at Meetup">Meetup</a> and we'll get back to you.</p>
