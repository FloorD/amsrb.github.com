        <p>Delayed by one week, but it is happening nonetheless: Drinks &amp; Laughs.</p>

        <p>Join us on Tue May 26 in De Bierfabriek for a casual (Ruby-) conversation along with a local beer. We're expecting you from 7pm.</p>

Do you want to get your name out in NL's biggest Ruby community? All it takes is buying us some beer.
