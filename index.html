          This month's 3rd Tuesday is drawing near, and you know what that means.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're postponing the anticipated Hack Night in favour of another Talks &amp; Drinks event.
          "But why?", you ask. Well, because we don't want to skip on the opportunity to have DHH on the show!
          That's right, the creator of Ruby on Rails will be talking to us about the plans for Rails 5 in a Skype session.
        </p>
        <p>
        Of course there will be other speakers too! Sign up already, or stay tuned for more details.
