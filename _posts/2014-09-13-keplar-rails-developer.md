JOB  
If you are a Ruby (-on Rails) Developer or used to be one and want to
get back in the saddle, this role would be well suited for you. As an
ambitious developer this is a great chance to work on the cutting
(sometimes bleeding) edge of technology. You always try to incorporate
new technologies in your work and be creative to solve the most
challenging technical questions delivering some unique software to our
national and international clients.

SKILLS  
We are looking for a Developer who has a drive and passion for
technology. Outside your job you are interested in anything that’s
plugged-in. Maybe you made some nice contributions to the Open Source
community. While coding you stick to conventions and have a clean style.
Performance and optimization of your software is a self-evident part of
your workflow. You have experience with test-suites and benchmarking of
your code. After building your software according to spec you know how
to bootstrap a (cloud-) server and deploy your code effectively.

REQUIREMENTS  
A minimum of 3–5 years of experience in a professional environment
working with Ruby (-on Rails). Apart from Ruby, you have extensive
knowledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as common database
solutions. You know how to build a RESTful API and have some defendable
ideas about how to set up your MVC-projects. If your JavaScript skills
also stretch as wide as knowledge about AngularJS or other
JavaScript-based frameworks, that would be a big plus. You demonstrate a
broad skill set with the desire to stay up-to-date and learn new
technologies while keeping an eye on the Open Source community. You have
a proven track-record working on project teams and working with
deadlines. Some of the technologies we work with, that we hope you are
interested in: AngularJS, Capistrano, Chef, CoffeeScript, Git, Haml,
Middleman, MongoDB, MySQL, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, RSpec and Sass.
