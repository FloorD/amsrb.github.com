What do you want to learn? How will you get there?

These are the questions you will help solve as an engineer working at
Springest. [Springest](https://www.springest.com/) wants to become the
largest source for learning in the world. From books and e-learning
courses to onsite trainings, we help our users discover, compare, and
book everything they need to reach their personal and professional
learning goals.

We have a strong product focus in which everything revolves around the
users of our [Dutch](https://www.springest.nl/),
[German](https://www.springest.de/), [UK](https://www.springest.co.uk/),
and [US](https://www.springest.com/) sites. Next to that, more and more
organisations are using our [SaaS
tools](https://business.springest.com/) to stimulate and manage learning
for their employees.

Working at Springest
--------------------

We are looking for a full-time senior Ruby developer to join our growing
engineering team. We don‚Äôt have managers at Springest, but processes,
and we feel that individuals taking responsibility is very important. At
Springest, you will work in close collaboration with product owners,
marketing, and sales colleagues. You are also a member of our
development team where we discuss architecture, infrastructure, and keep
a close watch on security and performance.

Our main application runs on Ruby on Rails backed by Postgres, Redis and
Memcached. Next to that we rely on Elasticsearch to power our search
which is a big part of our product. We also have some smaller Go and
Elixir projects in production.

We are hosted on AWS and make heavy use of their offerings like RDS,
CloudWatch, Elastic Beanstalk and EC2 Container Service.

Next to our main application we build internal tools whenever necessary
to help ourselves and our growing Learning Advisor team. It is extremely
rewarding to see small development projects make a big impact for other
Springeteers, which in turn can result in more of our visitors being
helped of course!

Hackdays!
---------

![](http://img.springe.st/springest_hackday.jpg)

We do a regular internal hackday every month where we drop everything
and work on something completely different, which we feel is super
valuable for coming up with new ideas. We might give a new programming
language a shot, try out an idea someone‚Äôs been toying with for a while
or hack on some actual hardware (that‚Äôs our temperature sensor above in
its beginning stages!).

A lot of hackday ideas actually became super important for our company,
its a great chance to experiment with something that could grow out to
become a key factor of our business.

Check [our
recap](http://devblog.springest.com/springest-june-hack-day-recap) of
the most recent hackday to read more about why we organise them.

Your New Colleagues
-------------------

![](http://img.springe.st/springest_cowboy_team.jpg)

At Springest you will work with around thirty
[colleagues](http://over.springest.nl/werken-bij-springest/) (that‚Äôs not
all of us and no we‚Äôre not always in full cowboy gear, this was our
Western themed SpringFest!) who all are very skilled at what they do and
all of them have a healthy dose of nerd skills that we really value. Our
Product Owners also regularly ship code!

Springeteers are a happy bunch and we often get together outside work to
enjoy free time as well. Our office is a cosy place where anything goes
and where we all take good care of together. If you‚Äôre not good at
ping-pong yet, you have a good chance of becoming good here as well! üèì.

We are all active organisers and members of Meetups and other forms of
knowledge exchange (learning is our hobby!) and we participate quite
actively in the Amsterdam startup ecosystem. In addition to that we get
a lot of attention for Springest being the poster boy of how
[Holacracy](http://over.springest.nl/2014/03/26/nl-ontdekt-holacracy/)
and GTD can work for an organisation, which in turn is due to our
organisational structure without managers and other unnecessary
overhead.
